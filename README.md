##About

LucOS is a work-in-progress, Java-based operating system based on the lightweight Nachos educational operating system. LucOS is being developed for learning purposes for myself to gain better knowledge of operating systems and systems programming, in tandem with taking Berkeley's CS-162 (Operating Systems and Systems Programming.

Special thanks to professor John Kubiatowicz and the University of Berkeley for making these lectures and materials available.
